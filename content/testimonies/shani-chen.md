“Lee’s Review is much more than a SAT center. The instructors are
          passionate about what they teach and truly care for their student’s
          understanding of materials instead of just their scores. Mr. Lee, Mrs.
          Lee, and the staff have made this education center feel like a second
          testimonies.”
