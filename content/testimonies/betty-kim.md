“I’ve attended Lee’s Review for writing, SAT I, and College Consulting,
          and in every class the teachers not only made sure I understood everything
          I needed to succeed as a student, but also supported me as a person
          learning to navigate the real world. I owe both my academy accomplishments
          and positive outlook on education to my Lee’s Review family.”
