At first, I joined Lee's Review for SAT prep. Their summer intensive pushed me past my limits, greatly improved my English and math skills, and helped ease a lot of my testing anxiety. Later in the school year, I started going to them for math tutoring, and with their help, I was able to earn an A in math for both semesters.\

In my junior year, I began college consultation with Lee's Review. Throughout the entire process, Mr. Lee and his entire team were incredibly helpful and caring. Mr. Kong gave me a lot of guidance in my essays that helped me feel more confident in my writing. Ms. Pan also provided lots of support with my activities section and teacher recommendation forms.\

Mr. Lee was a bright and insightful source throughout my college application journey. From check-in phone calls to lively meetings, he was always looking out for me and made sure I didn't lose myself in the process. He helped select colleges that were truly in my best interest and made sure every part of my application was filled out correctly. All of this has given me more confidence in myself, and I am truly grateful for all the help the team has given me. I was able to get into USC through Early Decision!\

Lee's Review was a great choice in all areas of my academic journey, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend Lee's Review for anyone seeking academic support or college consulting, as their dedication and care truly make a difference.
