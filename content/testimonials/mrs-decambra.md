“As a parent of children who attended Lee’s Review, I can personally say

that I wouldn’t have trusted anyone else with the guidance and instruction

of my children. Lee’s Review is so much more than a learning center, it is

a place where kids can grow in confidence and in character. As a teacher,

I know that students leave not only being prepared to take the SAT, but

also with a legitimate understanding of the material. The staff manages to

do all of this while still making the classes as engaging as possible with

games, jokes/stories, and just a genuine compassion for each and every one

of their students.”
