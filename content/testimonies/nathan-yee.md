“Being an Ivy League hopeful, I knew that I had to do some serious

preparation for the SATs – I actually live in Washington state, but I

heard about Lee’s Review through a friend. I really think that Lee’s

Review is something special. It has a truly dedicated staff that’s hard to

come by… and a solid program that most definitely produces results, given

that you’re willing to work for those results.”
