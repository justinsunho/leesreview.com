"The high school journey in preparation for college isn’t easy, but Lee’s
Review is there for you every step of the way. The Lee’s Review center
doesn’t just have staff, but mentors who are extremely passionate and
dedicated to helping you your best not only in high school, but in your
years after that. Lee’s Review provided me with a positive and supportive
learning environment that can’t be beat.”
