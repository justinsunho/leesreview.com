          “The Lee’s Review family shared with me the most uplifting love, care,
          passion, and intellectual prowess I’ve ever experienced. I learned a great
          deal about SATs but more importantly I understood who I was, what I was
          doing, and where I was heading. Engage in that experience. It’s the most
          rewarding gift of opportunity you’ll ever encounter.”
