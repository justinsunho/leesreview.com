“Lee’s Review has been part of our lives for the past three or four years.

Our older daughter Katy started with SAT Prep and continued with College

Consulting services. Our son William continued our relationship with Lee’s

with SAT Prep and College Consulting service as well. Throughout this time

at Lee’s we observed the great value and care that Mr. and Mrs. Lee and

their staff provided to our children. Our kids received excellent

preparation for their SAT exams and we all received excellent guidance

during the college application and selection process. What is a very

stressful process was made a lot of less stressful thanks to Lee’s Review.

We are very grateful we found them and now consider Mr. & Mrs. Lee and

their staff, family friends. Our kids were accepted at Stanford and USC in

large part due to the preparation and guidance that was provided by Mr. &

Mrs. Lee and their staff. Our family is forever grateful.”
