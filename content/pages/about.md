    title: Building a Supportive Community
    description: Our students are constantly immersed in a supportive community that
        inspires them to be passionate and purposeful in all areas of life. We
        encourage them to take pride in their studies and do our best to cultivate
        them into responsible, disciplined adults.  In order to benefit from and
        contribute to our learning-conducive atmosphere, students at Lee’s Review
        are expected to uphold certain standards. While we do not exclude students
        based on their test scores or grades, we do require that they genuinely
        commit to working diligently in and out of the classroom.
