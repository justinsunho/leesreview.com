        years. Our older daughter Katy started with SAT Prep and continued with
        College Consulting services. Our son William continued our relationship

      description: The first member of his family to attend college, College
        Consulting helped demystify the intimidating college application process
      quote: '"“Through their SAT Winter Boot camp, I improved my SAT score by almost
        800 points! I was a College Consulting student the summer of 2015
        through the end of second semester. I am the first in my family to go to
        college. The entire college applying process had always been a scary
        black hole that I had no idea where to begin. They worked with me weekly
        and showed me all of their know-hows and wisdom of the college admission
        process ranging from essay writing (personal statement and individual
        supplements), application building, college choice based upon major, and
        literally anything else a student can or will need throughout their
        application process."'

      quote: “As a parent of children who attended Lee’s Review, I can personally say
        that I wouldn’t have trusted anyone else with the guidance and
        instruction of my children. Lee’s Review is so much more than a learning
        center, it is a place where kids can grow in confidence and in
        character. As a teacher, I know that students leave not only being
        prepared to take the SAT, but also with a legitimate understanding of
        the material. "
