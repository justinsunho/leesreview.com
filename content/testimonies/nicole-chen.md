“The Lee’s Review family did so much more for me than simply being my
college consultants. Their energy, positivity, and affection heavily
influenced the way I looked at like. It was never just about getting good
grade anymore, but developing myself as a person and learning to fulfill
my own curiosity. Their positive impact on me has aspired me to make a
difference in society and make this world a better place as a software
engineer. I will always contribute a huge part of my success to the Lee’s
Review family.”
