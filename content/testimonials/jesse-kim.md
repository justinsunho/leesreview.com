What stood out to me over time was that this place isn't just about college applications. It's about the student as a whole, and that shows in the way they interact, advise, and follow through. It never feels like they're just trying to get students into college and move on. They really focus on who the student is and what will be best for them long-term.\
\
Mr. Lee is incredibly knowledgeable about colleges and truly takes the time to understand each student's strengths, interests, and goals. He doesn't push just for one outcome. Instead, he helps students find schools where they will genuinely thrive, both academically and personally. His guidance goes far beyond applications (he gives great advice about sleeping), and it's clear he cares just as much about how students grow after acceptance as he does about the acceptance itself.\
\
The essay process was another moment where that care really showed. Mr. Kong and Ms. Pan are excellent editors, but they are also people you can really trust. They create an environment where you feel safe being honest, even vulnerable, and that honesty comes through in the writing. The essays don't feel manufactured; they feel like the student.\
\
Between the individualized guidance, essay support, workshops for the Common App and interviews, and continued advising even after acceptance and through financial aid decisions, it's clear this team is invested for the long run. We are extremely grateful to be working with them and would wholeheartedly recommend them to any family looking for support that is both professional and deeply personal.
