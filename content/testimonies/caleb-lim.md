“Growing up in a relatively academically rigorous region, I’ve had many
help from different institutions. However, the care and exhaustive work
demonstrated by the faculty of Lee’s review by far surpasses those I’ve
seen at any other institution. Through the guidance of Lee’s staff, I was
able to set up the right path for academic and extracurricular successes
and get accepted into my dream school in minimal time. Even on the other
side of the country, I’m able to apply what I’ve learned throughout my 5
years experience with Lee’s Review.”
