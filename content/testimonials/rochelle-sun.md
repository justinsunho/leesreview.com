“Beyond just the essay review and application management that is what
constitutes the black and white of the college application process, Lee’s
Review provided valuable guidance and a supportive environment to help me
develop into a more well-rounded and successful student — both in high
school and in college. The encouragement and genuine care that each of the
members of the Lee’s Review family give to all of their students is truly
inspiring, and I would not be where I am today without their support.”
