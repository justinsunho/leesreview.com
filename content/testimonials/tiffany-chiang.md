“At Lee’s Review, I felt the staff were my second family, and still
continue to be. I struggled with my SATs and my college application, but
they guided me through the whole process. They also helped me through my
lowest points of my life and support me to achieve my goals. They truly
give the attention and care students need to succeed. I am so glad they
have been apart my life because without them, I would not be where I am
today.”
