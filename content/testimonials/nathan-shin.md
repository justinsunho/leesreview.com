“Lee’s Review was one of the most prominent parts of my high school
career. I had the privilege of attending the learning center for four
years and enjoyed each and every class. I was fortunate enough to be
taught by the skilled staff that makes Lee’s Review so unique among other
tutoring centers. I owe my work ethic and development to the caring,
compassionate, and charismatic tutors who advocate a complete life, one
that conjoins hard work with rest and relaxation. I am able to maintain a
positive outlook on life because of the supportive people at Lee’s Review,
including but not limited to my peers. Going to Lee’s Review was the
‘least’ difficult decision I have ever made.”
