“At Lee’s Review I not only raised my SAT scores by 500 points but also

was accepted into my dream college, Rice University. Lee’s Review was and

still remains my second testimonies. To say that the staff goes above and beyond

is an understatement. I would have been lost throughout the college

application process without the helpful advice and guidance from Lee’s

Review. After college consulting, the staff still lends an extremely

helpful hand to me. It is not a goodbye when a session ends, but rather

until next time.”
