Working with Mr. Lee was one of the most meaningful parts of my entire college application journey. He was so much more than just a college counselor. He was a life coach, mentor, and a constant source of encouragement during one of the most stressful times in my life.\
From day one, Mr. Lee was incredibly kind, bubbly, and welcoming. Every meeting felt comfortable and judgment-free, which made it easy to ask questions and be honest about any doubts I had. His commitment to his students goes far beyond what is expected of a college counselor. There were countless times when he took time out of his own breaks or days off just to check in, answer questions, or talk things through with me, never once making me feel like a burden or an inconvenience.\
What really sets him apart is how deeply he cares. He didn't just help me build college applications. He helped me build confidence and trust in myself. He was always genuinely invested in my growth, both academically and personally - I always felt supported working with Mr. Lee.\
In the end, I got into my dream school! It would not have been possible without the help of Mr. Lee, and of course, the amazing Mr. Kong and Ms. Pan, who helped with my essays. But again, it wasn't just the acceptance that I got out of Lee's Review - I learned so many life lessons that I will definitely be carrying with me to college, and made so many special relationships throughout the process. I cannot thank Mr. Lee enough. He went above and beyond to support me every step of the way. Thank you, Mr. Lee!
