“I first came to Lee’s Review for their renowned SAT program to boost my
score. While it did improve my numbers, it also provided me with something
I did not expect: a dedicated group of mentors that not only complete
their job, but go above and beyond by creating a community where students
want to learn. Through Lee’s Review, I’ve been able to not only get into a
good college, but excel at the college I am at. The staff at Lee’s Review
doesn’t just teach students, but cares about them. I loved going to Lee’s
Review not only because of the great learning experiences, but because of
the great people in the organization.”
