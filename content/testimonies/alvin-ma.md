“Only at Lee’s Review have I been able to meet a group of people who were
so supportive, so helpful, so intent on making sure that their students
succeed. Being a part of the Lee’s Review family has not only been a
tremendous experience but it has helped me grow into a more focused and
determined individual for college.”
