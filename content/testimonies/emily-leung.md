“The entire staff at Lee’s Review truly cares about more than just your
academic success. I was not only provided with thorough guidance through
numerous college essays and interviews but also a valuable support system
that surpassed the college application process. I truly feel that I am at
the right college for me, and I am beyond grateful to have had the
guidance and support of the Lee’s Review staff to guide me along the way.”
