The Lee’s Review staff guided me through every step of the college
          application process with utmost care and attention to detail. Each of my
          essays was edited and revised numerous times by several different teachers
          and with each revision came new suggestions and improvements. The Lee’s
          Review staff achieves the perfect balance between helping its students
          create well written and thoughtful college applications and ensuring that
          each student’s voice and personality is reflected.
