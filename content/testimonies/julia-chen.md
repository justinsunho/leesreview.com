“I truly feel blessed to have had the Lee’s Review staff help guide me
          through not only the SAT and ACT test, but also the college application
          process. I always felt comfortable at Lee’s Review exploring who I was and
          who I hoped to become with the incredibly nurturing and encouraging staff
          by my side. Mr. Lee, as well as the rest of the staff, provides genuine
          interest, support, and guidance for whatever you dream of pursuing. Anyone
          who decides to join the Lee’s Review family will not regret it and will
          definitely grow from the experience.”
