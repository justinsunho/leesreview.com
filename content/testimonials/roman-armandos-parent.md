Rarely do you find a group of people that care more for the students, than at Lee's Review. Specially Mr. Lee. He goes out of his way to encourage the students to do better in everything. Down to their sleep habits. These affect their academic development.\
They assist students with everything from helping them choose the best classes during high school, help choose a career, AP tests, SAT tests, choosing and applying to colleges. Including the essay writing. ‼\
\
Once accepted, Mr. Lee can help advise which college would be best suited and will also help with the application for financial aid.\
\
Soo helps to coordinate all schedules and trainings with the different tutors. She is very sweet and perseveres to make schedules work well.\
\
They have special workshops to complete the Common App and even on how to prepare for interviews.\
\
We are very happy to be working with them.
