    academic support so that our students can be in an environment that fosters
    a true appreciation of learning.

  title: Building a Supportive Community
  description: Our students are constantly immersed in a supportive community that
    inspires them to be passionate and purposeful in all areas of life. We
    encourage them to take pride in their studies and do our best to cultivate
    them into responsible, disciplined adults.  In order to benefit from and
    contribute to our learning-conducive atmosphere, students at Lee’s Review
    are expected to uphold certain standards. While we do not exclude students
    based on their test scores or grades, we do require that they genuinely
    commit to working diligently in and out of the classroom.
