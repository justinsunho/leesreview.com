I am so thankful for the college consulting we received at Lee's Review for my daughter. Mr. Lee and his team were a tremendous help throughout the application process. Mr. Lee guided her in planning her activities and selecting the right colleges; his deep understanding of each institution's requirements helped us navigate the entire journey. With their support, my daughter was accepted to her first-choice college via Early Decision! I highly recommend Lee's Review to any parents looking for expert guidance for their children throughout high school and the transition to college.
