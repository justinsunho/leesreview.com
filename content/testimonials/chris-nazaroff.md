“The road to college can be scary and overwhelming. At Lee’s Review the
staff is dedicated to helping you succeed. They will answer any questions
you have about college and inform you on what you need to do. The very
skilled instructors teach in a way that you can understand. Lee’s Review
didn’t just help me on my SAT’s they helped me achieve my goal.”
