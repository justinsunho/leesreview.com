Lee’s Review is very student focused and was really helpful for me in staying accountable and in my college application journey overall! The staff is all very nice and try to understand you beyond just your status as a student, which allows them to better support you and your future goals when it comes to assisting you with essays and choosing colleges. The teachers are also very knowledgeable about what they teach and provided insight I hadn’t even considered when I was deciding on and applying to colleges
