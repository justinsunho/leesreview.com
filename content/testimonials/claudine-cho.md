"Through the warmth and honest care of Lee’s Review, I saw myself not only
developing into a more focused and balanced student, but also into a more
generous and loving person. It was never about the X, Y, and Z’s for
getting into college, but always about pursuing my personal ideals of
happiness. Simply put, I owe ALL my success and growth as a person to my
family at Lee’s Review.”
