“Lee’s Review will always mean so much more to me than where I practiced
the SAT. It is a place of love, encouragement, laughter, and family. They
gave me a confidence I had never before had in my studies and newfound
passion to pursue what made me happy. With the guidance of Lee’s Review, I
had no regrets after turning in my college applications because I truly
felt that they were the best of reflection of who I was and what I was
hoping to achieve in college. I was constantly aware that all of the
members of the Lee’s Review staff really cared about who I was a person,
not just my score on a test.”
