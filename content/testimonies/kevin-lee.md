“Through their SAT Winter Boot camp, I improved my SAT score by almost 800

points! I was a College Consulting student the summer of 2015 through the

end of second semester. I am the first in my family to go to college. The

entire college applying process had always been a scary black hole that I

had no idea where to begin. They worked with me weekly and showed me all

of their know-hows and wisdom of the college admission process ranging

from essay writing (personal statement and individual supplements),

application building, college choice based upon major, and literally

anything else a student can or will need throughout their application

process. I recommended my 14 year old sister to be involved with the Lee’s

Review at a early stage of high school to ensure her successes in her

pursue of her dream college. I say with a full heart that if it was not

for them there would have been no way I could have grown into the man I am

today with the success that I had accomplished. I admire them and all that

they stand for- the success of each student’s in and out of classroom

settings and the readiness for the brightest future each student can

grasp.”
