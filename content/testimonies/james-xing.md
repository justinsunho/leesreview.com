“Both vigorous and entertaining, the courses at Lee’s Review facilitate
          the unearthing of a student’s fullest potential. Through the course of two
          short summers, I was able to raise my SAT score of 1760 to 2270.
          Furthermore, I was able to integrate the knowledge I gained from there
          into many other aspects of life.”
