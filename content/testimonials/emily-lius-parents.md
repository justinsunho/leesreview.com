Choosing Lee's Review for my daughter, E. Liu's, college consultant was one of the best decisions we've ever made, and I can't express enough how grateful we are for the experience. From the very beginning, it was clear that Mr. Lee and his team weren't just about getting students into college -- they genuinely cared about our daughter, E. Liu, and her future.\
\
Mr. Lee is not only an expert in the college admissions process, but he's also one of the most patient and supportive people we've had the pleasure of working with. He took the time to truly understand who E. Liu is -- her dreams, her passions, her strengths -- and helped her highlight those things in a way that felt authentic and compelling. It never felt like a cookie-cutter service. Mr. Lee and his team gave E. Liu their full attention, and it showed.\
\
Very often, E. Liu would receive thoughtful and detailed feedback on her essays. And whenever she hit a roadblock, the entire team would rally around her to make sure she got the help she needed. It wasn't just a one-on-one service; it felt like we had an entire community behind us, cheering E. Liu on every step of the way.\
\
But what really sets Mr. Lee apart is how much he genuinely cares. He treats his students like family. He wasn't just concerned about E. Liu's college application--he cared about her well-being, making sure she didn't get too stressed or overwhelmed. He encouraged her to enjoy her high school years, reminding her (and us!) to keep a healthy balance and time management too. In a world where everything can feel so competitive, Mr. Lee was like a calm and reassuring presence. He was always there for us, answering even the smallest of questions, and giving us the confidence we needed during such an emotional time. Although there were 3-4 times when we couldn't reach Mr. Lee right away, he always made sure to call back promptly - within the same day, usually within an hour. We understand how busy he is as a college consultant, but it was clear that he prioritizes his students and gives urgent matters the attention they deserve.\
\
Thanks to Mr. Lee's and his wife's dedication, E. Liu was accepted into one of her top-choice schools, and we are beyond thrilled with the results. But even after she started college, Mr. Lee didn't just disappear. He still checks in on her, offering advice on classes and how to navigate college life. It's like having a mentor and friend who is always looking out for her.\
\
I can honestly say that choosing Lee's Review wasn't just about getting into college. It was about finding someone who truly cared about our daughter's success and happiness, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. We are so grateful to Mr. Lee and his team for everything they've done for E. Liu, and for us as a family.
