**How long have you been tutoring?** I've tutored on and off during college, but here at Lee's, it's been about 6 months so far!

**What was your favorite subject in high school?** I didn't have a favorite subject in high school--but I did in college! I fell in love with Political Science at UC Berkeley.

**Did you go to Lee's in high school?** *I went in the summer of 2015. I still remember plenty from my time back then--SAT vocab words like "capricious" are still fresh in my mind!*
