          “Through their SAT Winter Boot camp, I improved my SAT score by almost 800	
          points! I was a College Consulting student the summer of 2015 through the	
          end of second semester. I am the first in my family to go to college. The	
          entire college applying process had always been a scary black hole that I	
          had no idea where to begin. They worked with me weekly and showed me all	
          of their know-hows and wisdom of the college admission process ranging	
          from essay writing (personal statement and individual supplements),	
          application building, college choice based upon major, and literally	
          anything else a student can or will need throughout their application	
          process. I recommended my 14 year old sister to be involved with the Lee’s	
          Review at a early stage of high school to ensure her successes in her	
          pursue of her dream college. I say with a full heart that if it was not	
          for them there would have been no way I could have grown into the man I am	
          today with the success that I had accomplished. I admire them and all that	
          they stand for- the success of each student’s in and out of classroom	
          settings and the readiness for the brightest future each student can	
          grasp.”

          “At Lee’s Review, I felt the staff were my second family, and still	
          continue to be. I struggled with my SATs and my college application, but	
          they guided me through the whole process. They also helped me through my	
          lowest points of my life and support me to achieve my goals. They truly	
          give the attention and care students need to succeed. I am so glad they	
          have been apart my life because without them, I would not be where I am	
          today.”

          “At Lee’s Review I not only raised my SAT scores by 500 points but also	
          was accepted into my dream college, Rice University. Lee’s Review was and	
          still remains my second testimonies. To say that the staff goes above and beyond	
          is an understatement. I would have been lost throughout the college	
          application process without the helpful advice and guidance from Lee’s	
          Review. After college consulting, the staff still lends an extremely	
          helpful hand to me. It is not a goodbye when a session ends, but rather	
          until next time.”

          “Being an Ivy League hopeful, I knew that I had to do some serious	
          preparation for the SATs – I actually live in Washington state, but I	
          heard about Lee’s Review through a friend. I really think that Lee’s	
          Review is something special. It has a truly dedicated staff that’s hard to	
          come by… and a solid program that most definitely produces results, given	
          that you’re willing to work for those results.”

          “As a parent of children who attended Lee’s Review, I can personally say	
          that I wouldn’t have trusted anyone else with the guidance and instruction	
          of my children. Lee’s Review is so much more than a learning center, it is	
          a place where kids can grow in confidence and in character. As a teacher,	
          I know that students leave not only being prepared to take the SAT, but	
          also with a legitimate understanding of the material. The staff manages to	
          do all of this while still making the classes as engaging as possible with	
          games, jokes/stories, and just a genuine compassion for each and every one	
          of their students.”

          gave me a confidence I had never before had in my studies and newfound	
          passion to pursue what made me happy. With the guidance of Lee’s Review, I	
          had no regrets after turning in my college applications because I truly	
          felt that they were the best of reflection of who I was and what I was	
          hoping to achieve in college. I was constantly aware that all of the	
          members of the Lee’s Review staff really cared about who I was a person,	
          not just my score on a test.”

          guidance and support of the Lee’s Review staff to guide me along the way.”

          grade anymore, but developing myself as a person and learning to fulfill	
          my own curiosity. Their positive impact on me has aspired me to make a	
          difference in society and make this world a better place as a software

          I did not expect: a dedicated group of mentors that not only complete	
          their job, but go above and beyond by creating a community where students	
          want to learn. Through Lee’s Review, I’ve been able to not only get into a	
          good college, but excel at the college I am at. The staff at Lee’s Review	
          doesn’t just teach students, but cares about them. I loved going to Lee’s
